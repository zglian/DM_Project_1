## Overview
This project implements FP-Tree and Apriori algorithms for data mining tasks. It includes programming implementation, experimentation with different scenarios, and analysis of runtime statistics. The project also involves generating synthetic data using the IBM Generator and conducting experiments on datasets sourced from Kaggle/UCI.

## Dataset
The dataset used for testing the algorithms was generated using the IBM Generator as per the project requirements. It consists of synthetic transactional data with specified parameters.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **FP-Tree**: This algorithm is used for frequent itemset mining in transactional databases.
- **Apriori**: This classic algorithm is used for association rule mining in large datasets.

## Programming Language and Dependencies
The project is implemented in Python 3.7 without the use of external libraries. Only built-in libraries were utilized for the implementation.

## File Structure
- **inputs**: Directory for input files, including the synthetic dataset generated with the IBM Generator.
- **main.py**: Main script for executing the algorithms and generating output files.
- **outputs**: Directory for output files containing the results of the algorithms.

## Results
The experiments conducted on the provided dataset revealed interesting observations in different scenarios, including variations in support and confidence levels. The runtime statistics for each scenario were also analyzed to understand the performance of the algorithms.

## Bonus Experiment
Additionally, experiments were conducted on datasets sourced from Kaggle/UCI, including [dataset names]. The results of these experiments were compared with those obtained from the provided dataset, leading to valuable insights into algorithm performance and behavior across different datasets.

## Testing and Validation
The correctness and efficiency of the algorithms were validated through rigorous testing procedures. Challenges encountered during testing were addressed promptly to ensure the reliability of the implementation.
